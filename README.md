Welcome to BIFX 552
===================

Syllabus
--------

### Course Description

This class provides an introduction to applied data science skills
needed by bioinformatics professionals. A focus will be placed on
reproducible bioinformatics research and will include the following
topics and tools: beginning to intermediate use of the Unix command
line, working with remote computing resources, version tracking, R and
Bioconductor, tools for manipulating sequence data, and creation of
pipelines.

-   Instructor: Randall Johnson, PhD
-   Office Hours: In-person office hours will be held Thursdays
    immediately after class, and online meetings can be scheduled as
    needed.
-   Prerequisites: BIFX 503
-   Textbook: [Bioinformatics Data Skills: Reproducible and Robust
    Research with Open Source Tools 1st Edition, by Vince Buffalo,
    O'Reilly
    Media (2015)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449367372/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_u.7yEbR4PC24R)
-   Communications: All course communications will be posted on
    Blackboard. In order to receive timely notifications, it is
    recommended that you do one or more of the following:
    -   Check Blackboard often
    -   Set your Blackboard email notifications to alert you when
        something is posted
    -   Try the phone app.

### Learning Objectives

On completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the
following:

-   Use of the Unix command line to manipulate data and perform
    bioinformatic analysis tasks
-   Logging into and using remote computing resources
-   Working with version controlled code repositories in a collaborative
    work environment
-   Use of R and Bioconductor to perform bioinformatic analysis tasks
-   Stitching a series of commands and/or programs together into a
    reusable pipeline

### Homework

In addition to weekly reading assignments, there will be a homework
assignment that will need to be submitted on GitHub. The homework will
include a quiz, the purpose of which is to gauge understandig prior to
class. After submission of homework, students will be given answers and
a score, but only participation will be tracked for the purpose of
grading (i.e. if you complete both the module and the quiz, full points
will be awarded for grading purposes).

### Grading

Grades will be based on completion of homework, in-class participation,
and two exams.

-   Homework - 30%
-   In-class participation - 30%
-   Mid-term - 20%
-   Final exam - 20%

### Weather

In the event of severe weather resulting in the closure of Hood College
and the cancellation of a regularly scheduled class, the material from
the missed class will be posted on blackboard, and a live chat session
will be held to work through material and answer questions. Additional
time can be scheduled as needed.

### Tentative Schedule

Reading assignments are from Buffalo's Bioinformatics Data Skills unless
otherwise specified, and they should be read *prior* to class. More
details on reading assignments will be given on
[Blackboard](https://hood.blackboard.com/).
